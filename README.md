# XDev and Earth System Informatics Teams' Project Dashboard

This repository is used to generate a dashboard that allows statuses for various
services to be shown for all XDev and Earth System Informatics Teams' Projects.

The main configuration of the dashboard is done via the ``dashboard.yml`` file,
which can contain several sections with a list of packages, and a list of services for each
section.

The dashboard can be seen [here](http://ncar.github.io/xdev-status-dashboard)
